Unlike movies, TV series demand us to be invested for a considerable amount of time, so just looking at the highest ranking series on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) or [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) might not be enough for a wise decision regarding what TV show to watch next. Some get cancelled or have an abrupt final episode while others get extended way beyond what is reasonable. Some increase consistently in quality, season after season, while others linger in a clear writer's block, with episodes devoid of any inspiration.

So, the first criterion used to pick these series is that they must already have ended, otherwise they're susceptible to the above mentioned risks, so don't expect to find _The Mandalorian_, _Black Mirror_ or _Peaky Blinders_ in this list!

But the gist here is that _a series is as good as its worst season_ so, whilst these are the 50 top shows according to IMDb, they are sorted based on their worst season's rating (the last column), though you can still find the original whole-series score left of the title.

A crescendo is noticeable in the number of seasons, as we got from the top to the bottom of the list, confirming that greed on milking the cow until it dries up really runs against artistic and literary creativity!
