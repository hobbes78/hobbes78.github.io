## Welcome

According to Google Trends, blogs have been steadily declining since 2009, with all the social networks that have been popping up. Yet, I still believe they're the unbeatable medium for expressing a mix of text, images and video, with way more freedom. So welcome, don't hesitate to chime in with comments and questions and I hope you leave wiser than you came!
